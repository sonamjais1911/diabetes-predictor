# diabetes-predictor

Developed a Web Application using FLASK to predict from given inputs whether a person has diabetes or not.
Used Pima_Indian_Diabetes dataset to train my machine learning model.
Trained the model on 5 different machine learning algorithms and chose the one with highest accuracy.
